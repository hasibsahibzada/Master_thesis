\section{Introduction}
During the last focus-group discussions and all gathered data from attraction attention study and interviews, the first paper prototype of interactive advertisement was decided to be created. This document describes the advertisement application requirements, lists all functionalities along with its use cases and defines the target group that this application is going to be made for. 

Paper prototype for Bauhaus-Walk [14] shows two different interactions (body and mobile) and tries to give an overall general picture of how the advertisement would look like after development, but to test this paper prototype, this document purposes a test design for complete evaluation of all important functionalities.


\section{Requirement gathering}

The bellow mentions Bauhaus-Walk advertisement?s all functional and non-functional requirements and what system requirement would be required at the time of development.

\subsection{Functional Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}
\item	Detect multi User.
\item	Assign a character to the user. 
\item	Assign a task to the user.
\item	Respond to each user interaction.
\item	Show advertisement text.
\item	End the interaction.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Non-functional Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}
\item	Performance \\
This is a very important requirement that should be wisely done. Response time should be very fast in both gesture and mobile interaction so the user could see the reaction quickly on the screen. 

\item	Scalability \\
The interaction is scalable for multi-users at the same time for body interaction and mobile interaction.

\item	Availability \\
Kinect camera should be functional during the experiment for people detection, Access point should be running so that it could provide network access to users.

\item	Usability \\
The advertisement interaction both mobile and body should meet all criteria of usability.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Personas}
The bellow personas are made based on focus group findings that most of people taking tour are elder people, which builds up our primary type of persona and secondary type persona would be young age girl as described bellow.

\section{Design study}
Bauhaus-Walk interactive advertisement consist of two elements, first is the screen that the users see the reaction and advertisement content, and the second is the means of interaction which are body and mobile, to design the test first of all the paper prototype should be capable to show both of these elements to be applicable to the real scenario later.  

Actual advertisement screen paper prototype would be made along with its all interactive objects and as well as mobile paper prototype for user interaction would also be printed we would not need any paper prototype for gesture interaction. I as an experimenter would simulate all user actions on the display even actions like movement of silhouette or character face

\subsection{Procedures}

The test subjects will be given basically one task by the interactive advertisement screen and by user body movement their location on the paper screen would be changed and checked for possible interactive object so that the content could be changed and for mobile interaction the subjects will be instructed to think-aloud while interacting with mobile interface so that examiner be able to change content on paper screen.

\subsection{Subjects}
Five participants will be will be invited to experience with the paper prototype.

\subsection{Evaluation}
The evaluation purpose is to find possible issues as listed bellow with interactive advertisement. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item	Confusing events
\item	Unclear events or interactions.
\item	Misconception of a function.
\item	Task confusion.
\item	Understandability of advertisement goal and contents.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Hypothesis}
Hypothesis are divided for each individual interactions like mobile and body.


\subsubsection{Body Interaction}

\begin{itemize}

\item H1: Users understand and react to the Call-to-Action approach.
\item H2: Users recognizes the character assigned to them.
\item H3: Users understands the tasks assigned to them.
\item H4: Users can explore locations by moving their body in physical space.
\item H5: Application raises alerts to specific user actions.
\item H6: Application motivates participants to continue playing.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Mobile Interaction}

\begin{itemize}
\item H1: Users understand the Access Information shown on the board.
\item H2: Users open the controller website by scanning QR-Code.
\item H3: Webpage application produces alerts with in correct user input.
\item H4: Users rotate the mobile phone to start game.
\item H5: Users understand the task.
\item H6: Users can navigate the character by moving the face in mobile.
\item H7: Screen application produces alerts for incorrect location.
\end{itemize}






\section{Data gathering}
The process of data gathering was as bellow, the methods are designed in a way to fully answer the research questions and the defined hypothesis.

\subsection{Video recording}
Each participant was video recorded for both body and mobile interactions for later observation and analyzing purpose. 

\subsection{Direct observation}
Participants were observed during the interaction and also asked about what they thought at that moment while interacting. When participants could not perform a task then they were asked exploratory questions on how would they do the task naturally.

\subsection{Think aloud}
Participants were asked to read their mind while interacting with the prototypes. This helped to understand what they thought about a specific interaction at that moment. 

\subsection{Interviews}
	After both paper prototype interactions were finished, a brief interview was taken to further learn about the interactions they did and get other user comments and feedbacks for the prototypes.

\section{Data Analyzing}
The important part for analyzing the data is shaped based on the defined hypothesis at the beginning; the bellow procedure was followed to best answer our open questions and to be able to evaluate both paper prototypes. 


\subsection{Usability issues chart}


\subsection{Body Interactions usability chart}

\hilight{put the body usability chart}


This chart was created to list all the possible, mistakes, misunderstandings and confusions for each of the interactions carried by participants, these lists were categorized under usability problem. This error chart was made during video observations, flow of the tasks were observed and also the words they used during interaction from which confusion, frustration and misunderstandings events were recorded. 

Looking through all the usability problem chart of each participant the bellow single chart is being created, each category is separately listed with the possible problems.



\subsubsection{Mobile usability chart}
The bellow chart lists all the possible issues with mobile interaction.

\section{Hypothesis decisions}

The hypothesis those were defined in the design study, from which some of them are accepted and rejected based on the above findings. 

\subsection{Body Interaction}
\begin{itemize}
\item H1: Users understand and react to the Call-to-Action approach.\\ 
\textbf{[Accepted]}\\
All of the participants understood call-to-action and reacted to it quickly as soon they read it.

\item H2: Users recognizes the character assigned to them.\\ 
\textbf{[Rejected]}\\

All the participants did not understand the character which was assigned to them, This happens when the participants do not have background to the related history that should know the character, It would be better to use someone who is very famous and is known to most of the population and different cultures, using very specific character is a bad idea. Users gets confused. At one occasion even an architect student who must know that face, but unfortunately did not recognized him. 

\item H3: Users understands the tasks assigned to them.  \\ 
\textbf{[Rejected]}\\
Most users did not understand the task in the sense of the defined character, but they did understand that they should walk and explore locations.

\item H4: Users can explore locations by moving their body in physical space. \\ 
\textbf{[Accepted]}\\
As soon they understand that the silhouette is them and projected on the screen, then they did the task by moving them selves physically, except one participant who did not understand until the observer gave him hint to move his self physically in right or left.

\item H5: Application raises alerts to specific user actions.   \\ 
\textbf{[Rejected]}\\
The application did not raised error for user?s specific interactions like if the user was out of the screen or very close to the screen. Most of the participants raised their hand up, or turned around, there was no alerts for the participants.

\item H6: Application motivates participants to continue playing. \\ 
\textbf{[Rejected]}\\
When the users explored the first location, they were excited and tried to see the other places, but all the locations action was predictable by the participants and nothing new was happening, participants expected more from their interactions to be more excited to play the whole game. They did finish the game because they were told so.

\end{itemize}


\subsection {Mobile Interaction}
\begin{itemize}
\item H1: Users understand the Access Information shown on the board. \\ 
\textbf{[Accepted]}\\
The participants were not shown the phone prototype at first, they were only shown the display and were asked to react based on the messages or what ever the users comprehend, after reading the Access information they asked for the phone prototype and then the phone prototype was shown to them to interact.

\item H2: Users open the controller website by scanning QR-Code. \\ 
\textbf{[Accepted]}\\
Four of the participants understood the use of QR-code and from which two of them scanned it and other two typed the IP address, and one participant did not understood the use of QR-code.

\item H3: Webpage application produces alerts with in correct user input.\\ 
\textbf{[Rejected]}\\
The webpage did not produce error at many occasions while filling the form like, what happens when cancel button is pressed, or when the game finishes the application does not alert user to replay or leave webpage.

\item H4: Users rotate the mobile phone to start game.\\ 
\textbf{[Rejected]}\\
Only two of the participants rotated the phone but the rest of the participants tapped on the icon and tried to rotate the icon in the screen instead rotating the whole phone.

\item H5: Users understand the task.\\ 
\textbf{[Rejected]}\\
This happened because all of the participants did not recognized the face and did not know where are his locations.

\item H6: Users can navigate the character by moving the face in mobile.\\ 
\textbf{[Rejected]}\\
Four of the participants touched and tapped the face shown on the mobile phone many times, they expected that something will happen after they touch the character like a dropdown list would appear to edit it, but one of the users drag it and saw the reaction on the screen.

\item H7: Screen application produces alerts for incorrect location.\\ 
\textbf{[Accepted]}\\
The incorrect locations that were explored by the participants were given an alert message.
\end{itemize}



\subsection {Interview analyzing}
The interviews were transcribed and color-coded for more accurate interpreting participant?s expectation and reaction upon the paper prototypes. 
See appendix B. 

\section{Conclusions}

Evaluation of low-fidelity prototype of advertisement was very helpful to understand possible design problems and interactions that could have been a headache if had identified at high-fidelity version. 

First, the body interaction was easily understood by most of the participants, this type of interaction is more natural and can be done by any kind of participant without having any technical expertise. Two most important interactions in this technique was the call-to-action which approached participants to come near to the screen and other was to explore the locations using their body position in physical space. This low-fidelity usability testing suggests bringing changes for the next high-fidelity version of the advertisement. The changes would be to remove the character assigning for individuals, improving alert messages for different user actions, improving task description and integrating features to increase interest rate for participants to be engaged with the advertisement.

Second, participants also appreciated the mobile interaction, but they were not so convinced for the usage because of many issues like logging in web application first, then navigating the face character. There was no clear instructions for how to navigate the character, and what will happen if there are many participants playing at the same time, where all of the participant would have the same face and they would get confused that which one is being controlled by their controller and lastly, it was unclear that what happens in web application when the interaction is over. This usability testing helped us to identify the mention usability problems and would bring changes for the new high fidelity version that would solve the current issues.

Third, The advertisement text, which was shown at the end of interaction, did not brought user?s attention, it would be better to make a short video for the next prototype that could bring users attention to see the advertisement. After the video advertisement gets over the attraction phase starts again.

Finally, all hypotheses that were accepted or reject will be taken in to account from which new decisions for the high fidelity version will be taken, this version will overcome all the issues discovered until this stage. Participant?s recommendations and feedbacks have also much value and would be considered in the development phase.
