\section{Advertising}

Advertisement is everywhere and it is meant to provide the audience information about the product or service. The advertisers want to gain the planned goals and effects from the specific target audience. it is a mean of mass communication that is created to alter the audience’s behavior and attitude \cite{advertisementdef}. In particular Kotler and Keller \cite{ad_def} defined the advertisement as below.

\begin{snugshade}
\begin{quote}\textbf{Defination: Advertising }\\ \\ \emph{Advertising is any paid form of non-personal presentation and promotion of ideas, goods, or services by an identified sponsor. Advertisers include not only business firms but also charitable, nonprofit, and government agencies}\end{quote}
\end{snugshade}

So based on the definition above, advertisement is non-personal meaning it is meant to a group of people or target groups. Secondly it should represent an idea or basically it should have something to deliver for the people which matters to the audience. It normally has sponsor(s) to launch it somewhere for example on TV, Radio or print a poster version outdoor. The way message is being delivered has been changing at every era of development as discussed below.




\subsection{History of advertisement}
%From very old ages as from 13th century advertising has played an important role to promote customers attention and be able to compete with one another, 
The first paper advertisement was published at 1704 in an American newspaper called Boston News Letter, which was about houses and lands to be sold\footnote{Paper advertisements: http://infoacrs.com/a/adhistory.html, Last accessed 16th March 2016}. After that a lot of business started to do their advertisements in newspapers, posters and banners. The first television advertisement was shown at 1941 on an American TV\footnote {First TV ad: http://www.openculture.com/2013/08/watch-the-first-commercial-ever-shown-on-american-tv-1941.html, Last accessed 16th March 2016}, this ad brought attention to a wide area of application and big business industries toward advertisement. As a result the budgets raised much higher for advertisements and later advertisement entered the World Wide Web. Online advertising has evolved now to multi-billion dollar industry. Now because of the emerging new technologies and advancements, advertisements are in our smart phone applications, smart TV sets, tablet PCs and many other smart devices. And from past decades display screens are replacing print advertisements because of the easy reusability of the screen and convenient usage of them and providing dynamic contents.

\subsection{Traditional Advertising}
Traditional advertising is a form of advertising that uses the media to send commercial messages to the mass audience or viewers.The media can be in any form like TV, Newspaper, Radio, public displays, bill boards and more. Traditional advertising is “the presentation of content is linear and the consumer is passively exposed to product information” \cite{Non_inter_vs_interAd}, user has no control over the flow of the advertisement. 


\subsection{Online advertising}
Online advertising or Internet advertising is a form of advertising that uses email, web, applications, or any internet application used in mobile or computer, which drive direct sales via electronic commerce \cite{onlinead}. As \emph{PWC}  \cite{pwc} researched on online advertising and stated that there are two trends that give online advertising this boost, (1) increase in webpages, and (2) development in targeted advertising format. Beside that there are a lot of other ways to boost online marketing \cite{waysmarketing}, (1) search engine optimization, to suggest websites for users, (2) email, (3) video marketing, like YouTube, (4) Blogging , (5) social media, like Facebook, and many other forms.


\subsection{Pervasive Advertising}
Currently computers play important role in life because it is becoming nearly common and found everywhere. These computers do not have to be necessarily like traditional computers to have keyboard and mouse. It could be from our laptop to a smart watch or even smart pen and these technologies try blend in our environments like displays, sensor, security cameras, fridge, washing machine and more. As a result we have ubiquitous computing environment that is supported by underlying technologies like Internet, middleware and microprocessors, as explained by Mark Weiser \footnote{Ubiquitous Computing: http://www.ubiq.com/hypertext/weiser/UbiHome.html}  \cite{ubiquitous_computing} ``\emph{Ubiquitous computing is the method of enhancing computer use by making many computers available throughout the physical environment, but making them effectively invisible to the user}''. The term pervasive computing is also used instead of ubiquitous  \cite{pervasiv_ubiquitous}. It is constructed from basic elements \cite{pervais_ad} (1) ubiquitous access, (2) context awareness, (3) intelligence and (4) natural interaction. And when an advertisement is made with the help of pervasive computing then it is called ``\emph{pervasive advertising}''. This form of advertising would really help to improve advertisement in general because of the powerful properties of the pervasive computing like ubiquitous feature that computing is integrated seamlessly in environment and it disappears. Mark Weiser’s \cite{twenty_first} another central statement was ``\emph{The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it}''. Based on above explanation, ``\emph{Pervasive advertising is the use of pervasive computing technologies for advertising purposes.}''\cite{pervasiv_ad}.

\subsection{Advertising program}
To have and effective and efficient advertising, most big advertising industries follow an advertising program after they have defined the target market and buyer motives. The advertising program is also called as \emph{5Ms} \cite{adprogram}, because it is composed of five steps (1)\emph{Mission},(2) \emph{Money},(3) \emph{Message},(4)\emph{Media},(5) \emph{Measurement}, Figure \ref{fig:adprograme} shows these steps.

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Mission:} \\
Advertising mission (goal) should come from prior decisions on targeted market and location. This goal can be achieved by a fixed communication process in fix duration between advertiser and audience. There are three advertising goals (1) \emph{Informative Advertising}, it is the early advertising stage, which aims to inform target audience about a product which was not in market before. (2) \emph{Persuasive Advertising}, this happens when there are several competitors of the same product. The advertiser persuades people that their product is the best than others. And (3) \emph{Reminder Advertising}, the need of this type is when a product has been in market from long time like \emph{Coca-Cola} and then there is a need to remind people about that product.

\item \textbf{Money:} \\
Decision on advertising budget is very essential for future of company. The company should clearly invest on the advertising of certain product. It should be not less to have lower effect and not too high to risk the company benefits. 

\item \textbf{Message:} \\
The message of the advertising should be very clear and innovative. The message should be generated in a way that can impact on viewers. It should go from four stages, (1) message generation, (2) message evaluation and selection, (3) message execution and (4) social responsibility review.

\item \textbf{Media:} \\
The media selection is important because it can help to expose an advertisement message with the number of desired times to the target audience. The number of exposures of advertisement can define the number of awareness of audience about product. And the effect of exposure depends on, (1)\emph{reach}, how much can the advertiser reach to users, through internet, banners, TV and so on. (2) \emph{Frequency}, how many times that advertisement is going to be shown on those locations, (3)\emph{Impact}, the qualitative value of exposure on audience.

\item \textbf{Measurement:} \\
The last step is to measure how the advertisement was effective for a defined goal, location, and target audience within a specific duration of time. The measurement will state the level of achievements and what got accomplished and what not.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Advertisement performance}
\label{adperformancebackground}
Every advertiser is interested in \emph{conversion-rate}, it is ``\emph{the percentage of visitors who take a desired action.}''\cite{convrate}. The desired action is to visit a webpage, buy a product, play a game, or any action, which is defined by the advertiser. \emph{conversion-rate} is very important for advertiser to see the efficiency of their advertisements and how to utilize it for mass visitors that could be more effective. In e-commerce, advertisers track user’s each step or click, they track users from search engines to webpages, from webpages to contacts, from contacts to subscribers and from subscribers to \emph{Actions} purchase or download of an application. With the help of a technique called \emph{conversion-funnel} \cite{convfunnel}, all the journey of visitors are described in a funnel like shape, as Saad Kamal \cite{googlefunnel} describes the conversion funnel in Google Analytics, see figure. \ref{fig:conversion_funnel} the funnel is composed of four layers, (1) Awareness or attention, (2) interest, (3) Desire and (4) Action, and visitors would have to take these steps to reach the final goal which is purchase of a product. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=100mm,height=80mm]{Figures/2/con-funnel}
\caption{Conversion Funnel}
\label{fig:conversion_funnel}
\end{figure}

The funnel shape shows the decrease of visitors in each layer of funnel because most visitors may be aware but not interested, and people who are interested are subset of the first layer of funnel. Not all interested people desire to buy a product, so people get decrease in the next layer who desire for a product and may read the details and specifications. But not all people who desire to buy the product because maybe the person does not have money to buy or there could be other reasons. And finally very few people fit to buy the product and reach the final layer of funnel (purchase). 
Advertisers can aim different visitors at different layers of \emph{conversion-funnel}, and based on analysis of the funnel advertisers can define where exactly the advertising effort should be invested, \cite{ad_effor_funnel}


The conversion ratio is defined by \emph{click-through rate} (CTR) metric. It is the ratio of the number of clicks on advertisement to the number of visitors who makes impression (see the advertisement) \cite{convfunnel}. Advertisers optimize their pages, by analyzing that which sections, links of web pages can result in to higher CTR. To compute the \emph{ conversion rates } the below metrics are used.


\begin{itemize}
\item CPM (Cost Per Thousand) \\
It is a benchmarking metric in advertising to calculate the cost of an online advertisement, which is defined by showing an ad to thousand of viewers. Advertisers would be charged per impression (thousand of viewers). 

\item CPC (Cost per Click) \\
The advertiser is charged when a viewer clicks on the advertisement message or link. Occasionally it is found in search engines, and famous websites. 

\item CPA (Cost per Action)\\
Advertisers will be charged if the viewer performs any form of action like click, register, subscribe, fill a form or any other.

\end{itemize}



\section{Public displays}
Displays are increasingly getting cheaper and being used in various locations like restaurants, hotels, sport stadiums, homes and now in public space like shop windows, supermarkets, airport and streets and roads. Most of these displays show advertisement in which dynamic or static contents are being shown. Few of displays are interactive like purchasing train tickets with a touch capability, and even interactive advertisement displays in which passers-by can be engaged and play game. 
This section discusses on the history of public displays, novel applications of displays, display’s sensing technologies, attracting attention methods and interaction design of displays. This section also discusses on how to evaluate the public displays in great detail. 



%\begin{snugshade}

\subsection{History of public display research}
Various researches have been done from the past three decades and are still continuing until today on public displays. The first research was conducted in 1980 called the ``\emph{Hole-in-Space}'' \footnote{Hole-In-Space: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyIJJr6Ldg8} that connected New York and Los Angeles one side-walk with a live video and sound system. People at both ends could hear and see each other. In this research common behavior and interactions of people were explored and other similar researches had also been done.

Different sized displays were also designed to fit working area and space for various tasks. Mark Weiser illustrated in his paper ``\emph{Computer for 21th century}'' \cite{newgenerationcomputer}, in which he present tabs, pads, and boards devices which could be used as a personal use. He also showed large scale displays equivalent to blackboard for public use and demonstrated that how can these technologies be integrated as ubiquitous and be adjustable based on user demands and context. 

Another research on situated displays that projects content based on location. For-example  \emph{FLUMP}\footnote{flexible ubiquitous monitor project: http://research.cs.ncl.ac.uk/cabernet/www.laas.research.ec.org/ \\ cabernet/workshops/radicals/1996/papers/flump-finney.html, last accessed May 15, 2016.} \cite{flump}, was designed to research and illustrate the effectiveness and adaptability of ubiquitous computing systems. Many researches also conducted to design wearable displays like Meme tags and group tags \cite{meme-tags} that by wearing the displays participants could share ideas and opinions called “memes-succinct” among themselves. Through large displays called “community Mirrors” these memetics exchanges were visualized live for conference audience. Another “Name tags or thinking Tag” from IBM \cite{ibmtags} that could show the name of the person when facing another person and also display relevant information on who is viewing the tag.

Furthermore, ambient displays were also researched. For-example the \emph{Waterlamp and the pinwheels} used \emph{ambientRoom} of Ishii and ullmer \cite{ambient}, in which they showed how tangible bits could connect the cyberspace and physical environment like foreground and background of human activities. The room was kind of augmented space using light, sound and airflow and water movement. Another was \emph{office plant\#1} \cite{office_plant}, which was an exploration of a technological object adapted to the office ecology. Another was \emph{Information Percolator} \cite{information_precolator}, an ambient display designed to show expressions placed within decorative objects \footnote{Information Percolator : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LGQWhCePc8, last accessed:16 May 2016},  Greenber and Michael \cite{shared_notes}. The study investigated on how people transition from individual interaction to group work with the use of PDAs and shared displays and based on this they introduced SharedNotes system and illustrated how people can switch to different modes.

Encouraging social interaction was another important aspect for public displays in which researchers like Chew and leclerc \cite{chew_interaction} focused conversations in a conference setting using display called \emph{Sparks}. It was ``\emph{an ambient social networking and communication facilitation interface}'' this had interactive features on information related to elements presented in the space. Another interactive display designed for hospital \emph{AwareMedia} \cite{ interactive_hospital}, which facilitated  social, spatial, and temporal awareness and supported coordination at an operation ward. Gesture based interactions with ambient display was researched by Daniel Vogel \cite{vogel} that developed interaction framework for sharable, and interactive public ambient displays\footnote{Interactive Public ambient display:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFl71SPeYto, last accessed: 16 May 2016}. \emph{Blueboard} \cite{blueboard}, which was developed at IBM Research center, was a display system for groups to exchange information in a walk-by situation. \emph{IM here} \cite{ imahere} by Elaine M.Haung that researched on LDGAs \footnote{Large display groupware applications} and proposed a design on how to share IM\footnote{Internet messaging} on large displays by using mobile phone that helped to be an awareness and communication tool.

At end of 2000s mobile phones became popular and common among people and was also a good mean of interaction with displays. \emph{C-Blink} \cite{cblink} that used mobile phone display, which was used as light source that sent various hue color to a camera from which the camera would detect and encode information and present on large display. Another approach was the use of Flashlight of phones as a pointing device as Shirazi and winkler \cite{flashlight} described the design of public-private display with flashlight simple interaction. Other features of phone like Bluetooth, Infrared were also used as an interaction mean with display (e.g., \cite{bluetooth2, Bluetooth}).

Consequently advertising also became a focus for researchers. As Krüger and Müller illustrated their design of how to recognize passers-by via Bluetooth \cite{toward_situated}. A most relevant information could be shown to passers-by based on their staying duration and whether they read the content or not. \emph{BlueScreen} \cite{bluescreen} which selected and displayed adverts in response to detected users in the audience, stepping more further it gave users choice of changing and reforming the content shown on display. \emph{Prospero project} \cite{prospero} that developed a display framework that could be configurable and controlled in public.  \emph{RunWithUs} \cite{runwithuse} a social sport application that motivated people to do sport and share their progress. \emph{Digifieds} \cite{digifieds} another plateform that users could post ads in public displays.


\subsection{Auto-active displays}
Beside hundreds of researches on public displays in universities, there are other displays that were and are made by private advertisement industries. Most of these displays are auto-active or non-interactive and they are situated in train station, airports, malls, restaurants and various locations mainly for advertisement purposes. \emph{zipper}\cite{zipper}at year 1928 made LED display at the front corner of the New York Times building, which was showing current headlines. In Olympic 1979 the very first large display was deployed, which had video enabled \footnote{Olympic glory a short history of Olympic games timing. London in August 2012 \url{http://www.runnersworld.com/olympics/a-short-history-of-the-olympic-games, last accessed:18 May 2016}}. There are various other companies that until now are working like \emph{printsign} \footnote{printsigne: \url{http://www.printsign.co.uk/}, last access 19 May 19, 2016}, a big company in UK that designs and advertises in big displays for their customers. \emph{Sony Ziris}\footnote{Sony ziris: \url{http://pro.sony.com/bbsc/ssr/cat-monitors/}, last accessed 19 May 2016}, the company that sells advertising screen, and supports advertising content to be played on their screens. \emph{BBC big screen}\footnote{BBC big screens: \url{http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/aboutthebbc/entries/ea215929-b57e-3bb9-8d01-e0433f93fd62}, last accessed 19 May 2016}, which started at 2013 by installing many of their big screens and shows BBC big live events. People who travel by taxi can watch on going advertising and news on go like \emph{taxi TV}\footnote{Taxi TV: \url{http://verifonemedia.com/networks/taxi-media/}}. Another world famous out door advertising company are \emph{ClearChannel} \footnote{\url{http://clearchanneloutdoor.com/}}, and  \emph{Dynascan}\footnote{ Dynascan: \url{http://www.dynascanusa.com/products/360-degree-led-video-displays/}}  that advertise in 360 degree big outdoor and indoor screens enabled with content management system that advertisement could be edited and changed.  \emph{Kinton}\footnote{Kinton: \url{http://www.kinoton.de/de/home.html}} another cylindrical LED screen company that supports for big solutions like advertising, cinema and more.


\subsection{Interactive displays}
Beside auto-active displays, there are a lot of interactive outdoor and indoor displays that is made by private companies too. For example  \emph{CocaCola}\footnote{Coca Cola Interactive: \url{https://mg337group10.wordpress.com/2015/04/04/coca-cola-and-interactive-advertising/}, last accessed 19 May 2016} is involved to make interactive advertisement in public display. \emph{MC Donald}\footnote{MC Donald Interactive Ad: \url{http://en.nolapeles.com/2011/06/16/mc-donalds-interactive-ad/}, last accessed 19 may 2016} allowed passers-by to connect to the advertisement board and play game and by winning get a coupon number from which he/she could get something for free from MC shop. Other public awareness interactive ads are also there like Interactive Hair-raising awareness\footnote{Hair awareness: \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqd6hgO_AOI} last accessed 20 May 2016} an interactive ad that was installed in train station and used ultra-sonic sensor to detect the arrival of train and the model hair was beautifully blown up. Another was an interactive billboard that to let passers-by stop child abuse\footnote{Child Abuse: \url{https://www.dramafever.com/news/powerful-billboard-lets-you-stop-child-abuse-/}, last accessed: 14 May 2016}. Advertisements could be done in various forms and now are in restaurants and bars like Clo Winebar\footnote{17 Awsome bars: \url{http://walyou.com/bars-and-restaurants-themes-geeks/}, last accessed 19 May 2016} a bar that customers are able to view and select orders from an interactive screen. \emph{pizzaHut} \footnote{PizzaHut: \url{http://www.fastcocreate.com/3027282/pizza-huts-interactive-touch-table-could-be\\-coming-to-a-restaurant-near-you}, last accessed 19 May 2016} an interactive display that allows customers to design their own pizza and order through it. Floor and wall projected interactive advertisement are also common like Aristoz\footnote{Ariztoz: \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH2TON7LRIY}, last accessed: 19 May 2016} that illustrates various examples of projection based interactive advertisement in supermarket, hotels and airports. \emph{JCDecaux}\footnote{JCDecaux: http://www.jcdecaux.com/en/, last accessed 19 May 2016} a France famous advertisement company is booming in innovative outdoor and indoor advertisement. Many more interactive advertisements are out there in public that brings joys and engaging experience to audience.  


\subsection{Engagement with displays}
There is not a single application which would claim to be perfect in situations because it could be good for a specific domain but would lack a lot of things from other perspectives. It also applies for public displays that are another mean of communication of passers-by and is more complex than other single user device. There are many layers of complexities that needs to be addressed when dealing with public display, for-example how passers-by be attracted toward display. When they are attracted toward display how to motivate them toward display to come near and interact. And how to design a better interaction medium for the users at that situation. These are all issues that need to be worked on. As Müller et al \cite{DesignSpace} illustrated a model of different interaction phases in which he called it \emph{Audience Funnel}, as he describes there are many stages until users actually interact with the advertisement. Attention and motivation will eventually lead to interaction and these stages follow each other if the first step fail the rest would not happen, so there is certain thresholds that people should exceed to transition from one mode to other. 


\subsubsection{Attention}
Most devices that are being used has an owner and the owner is aware of the device and pays attention to it, for example the owner of mobile phone pays attention to phone to do certain task. But public displays do not have an owner or in other words everyone can use them if higher attention is given to them. Therefor the responsibility is on displays to be able to provide enough attraction for the passers-by to be engaged. 
Various models of attracting attention have been developed and proposed, like Itti and Baldi \cite{attention1} made the bottom-up attention model meaning that the attention could be attracted if a strong external stimuli happen. The model shows various representation of input image like color and orientation that human brain cells are capable of interpreting them and based on input images the model predicts which area of the picture could have more attention. The model is also equipped with top-down approach meaning that the brain knows or has experience to certain regions of input image before shifting attention.  Florian Alt \cite{pervasiv_ad} stated from previous researches that the attention could be gained by behavioral urgencies and honeypot effect has also strong impact on attracting attention.

Behavioral urgencies models can predict how much a specific external stimulus can gain attention of someone. For example Franconeri and Simons \cite{franconeri} stated that ``\emph{Attention capture is often operationally defined as speeded search performance when an otherwise nonpredictive stimulus happens to be the target of a visual search. That is, if a stimulus captures attention, it should be searched with priority even when it is irrelevant to the task}''. Beside this may other things captures attention like sudden appearance of object \cite{capturingattention}.

\emph{Honeypot effect} is described by Brignull and Rogeres \cite{EnticingPeople} that when ever a bunch of people gather around a display automatically other people are being attracted toward the display. They observed this effect in a party in which they had an interactive system installed called \emph{Opinionizer}. It was a shared display in which people could type their opinion with keyboard and the opinions were visualized on to the display. By doing this people started to notice the messages and most importantly the people involved with display built an awareness of people around toward display.


\subsubsection{Motivation}
To be motivated means \emph{to be moved to do something}\cite{motiv}.
Motivation is another big challenge for public displays because passers-by may glance toward display but necessarily not motivated to interact with the display. There is significant need to understand how to motivate passers-by toward display as Thomas \cite{toward_motivation} describes activities that motivates ``\emph{An activity is said to be intrinsically motivated if people engage in it “for its own sake," if they do not engage in the activity in order to receive some external reward such as money or status. I will use the words "fun," "interesting," "captivating," "appealing," and "intrinsically motivating," all more or less interchangeably,}'' he states that challenge, fantasy and curiosity could be categories of motivation instructions.

Challenge is a driving force for motivation, Florian alt \cite{pervasiv_ad} summarizes \emph{Flow}\cite{flow} that is state of mind in one sentence by saying ``\emph{is a state of mind where the user is fully immersed in an activity while feeling energized and focused. Simply said, flow can be achieved in a channel between too little challenge (leading to boredom) and too much challenge (leading to anxiety).}''. So there should be balance between challenges, and to change interaction to a challenge the end goal should not be clear for participants.   

Curiosity happens when something is not so clear and people tend to find what is actually happening. Some may feel insecure to or shy because of social context. Therefore proper explorative behavior is required to overcome these insecurities \cite{motiv}. To increase curiosity the application should send to the participant a sense of incompleteness and at the mean time should also show how to over come that incompleteness through the use of that application \cite{pervasiv_ad}.

Fantasy is another deriving factor to motivate people toward display. If something imaginary or unrealistic is shown people gives more attention, now with the increasing technologies and computer capabilities, virtual reality, augmented reality and others sensing technologies these fake environments can be built \cite{fantasy_metaphores}. \emph{BigBoard} \footnote{ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIHwHqaY3SY, last accessed: 19 May 2016} which was installed in a bus station and was showing the video of the side of the bus station and meanwhile was augmenting some fairies coming from sky and approach the participants. \emph{JCDecaux}\footnote{JCDecaux Innovative ads: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw0Gfp5LVgQ, last accessed 19 May 2016} creates innovative advertisements which most of them are full of fantasy. 

 



\subsection{Metaphors}
Advertisements are posted in various forms and there are different mental models categorized by J. Müller \cite{DesignSpace} which are Posters, windows, mirrors and overlays.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Posters: } \\
Ghosting and peter\cite{Poster_Ad} defines poster as like this, ``\emph{A poster is any piece of printed paper designed to be attached to a wall or vertical surface}''. These poster do contain texts, graphics or combination of both. They necessarily do not have to be paper based they could be digital posters that with the use of media a more dynamic contents could be shown. Most of these digital posters show traditional advertising contents that is often ignored by passers-by \cite{display_blindness}. But by integrating sensing technologies these posters could be interactive too to increase the user engagement.


\item \textbf{Windows: } \\
There are advertisements shown at windows facing outside the shop. This type of mental model gives the viewers some sort of clue of a virtual location. The window model has two sides \emph{the local} and \emph{remote} sides. The window model interconnects both sides together. For example \emph{Hole-in-Space}\cite{hole_space}, which there were two big screens installed in two major cities and live video and audio streams was available for public to communicate.

\item \textbf{Mirrors: } \\
Mirrors are reflective surfaces. Displays with mirror model show the reflection of the passers-by and allow encouraging them for more direct interactions. This is normally done by projecting silhouette representation for example J.Müller \cite{LookingGlass} experimented by mirroring three representations of passers-by as \emph{image}, \emph{silhouette} and \emph{abstract}.

\item \textbf{Overlays: } \\
Overlays model coul have various shapes and are not bounded to the fixed frame and size like screens or mirrors. It could be glass door or a part of a window or a whole wall. The fact is that they can integrate with environment. Normally these are done by using high performance projectors like CLD projector\footnote{LCD projector: \url{http://www.projectorreviews.com/projector-categories/lcd-projectors/}, last accessed 19 May 2016}. For example \emph{Jumping Frog} \cite{ meme-tags}that was projected on surface and by touching it the frog would jump to other surface.


\end{itemize}



\subsection{Interaction models}
Different interaction models are created as shown below that illustrates how passers-by would behave and react at certain regions (zones) toward display. How groups of audience can form and what could be their next step for interaction. 

\begin{enumerate}

\item Hallo.Wall \cite{hello_wall, hellow_wall_2}, which was a context-dependent display reflecting Identity and proximity of passers-by. This was designed to communicate detailed information as it was interactive and passers-by could communicate through RFID and WaveLAN technologies. The interaction was in a ``distance-dependent Semantic manner'' meaning that based on different distances various interactions were offered. The interaction model consisted three zones ambient zone, notification zone, and cell interaction zone as can be seen in below picture. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=100mm,height=60mm]{Figures/2/hello_wall}
\caption{Three zones of interaction, \cite{hellow_wall_2}}
\label{fig:threezoneofinteraction}
\end{figure}

\emph{Ambient Zone} is outside the sensing area where people cannot be tracked or sensed. In this mode the display shows some information and content independent to the people. \emph{Notification Zone} is the place where is under sensor range and the sensors can detect people and show particular light pattern on the display. \emph{Cell Interaction Zone} is the zone, where the passers-by are very near to the screen and can start interacting with display. 

D. Vogel \cite{vogel} used the same interaction design and enhanced it in a way that could support transition of implicit to explicit interaction with both personal and public information. He introduced \emph{Implicit, Subtle} and \emph{Personal} interaction zones that has smooth transitions in between. See the diagram below.


\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=100mm,height=60mm]{Figures/2/hello_wall_refined}
\caption{Four interaction phases, \cite{hellow_wall_2}}
\label{fig:threezoneofinteraction_2}
\end{figure}


\emph{Implicit interaction phase} is the phase where the system detects the person’s position and projects notification when user passes. In this phase it could also presents a kind of representation of the person so that the passers-by can see the reaction to be convinced to enter the subtle interaction phase. The \emph{Subtle mode} activates when user give implicit hints like stopping by screen. In this mode a detailed notification or state is shown in which user can start interacting with the content and multiple users can interact too. But when exploring more personal content then the users moves closer to the screen to enable \emph{Personal interaction phase}, in this phase the user is very close to the screen and the interaction could be done by touching the screen and exploring more personal contents. 

\item Another interaction model designed by Brignull and Rogers \cite{EnticingPeople} conceptualized an interaction model based on their observation they had done on \emph{Opinionizer} system in a lunch party. They divided the space around display in three categories as space (A) \emph{Peripheral awareness}, space (B) \emph{Focal awareness} and space(c) \emph{Direct interaction}. And illustrated how people switch between these spaces by crossing some thresholds. This model is limited to the interaction medium because one keyboard was used and other phases like implicate and explicit interactions are not considered. The model is made to be in an environment that people are somehow familiar with each other that remove social embarrassments and as a result people can interact freely with the system instead of ignoring it.

\item \emph{Audience funnel} \cite{AudienceFunnel} is another design based on public interaction flow model that have several interaction phases. The phases shown in this model is a linear process in which first should happen then next could happen. These phases are  \emph{Passing by, Viewing / Reacting, Subtle interaction, Direct interaction, Multiple interaction,} and \emph{Follow-up actions} as shown in below diagram. This type of model is very interesting for advertising applications.

\subsection{Technologies}
The driving force for all these designs and concepts and advancements are the technologies behind them. Without the use to advanced technologies it would have not been possible to implement and evaluate the prototypes and interaction designs. This section explores various technologies used for different purposes as listed below.


\begin{itemize}

\item Displays: \\
Currently four technologies are used in displays 

\begin{itemize}
\item CRT (Cathode Ray Tube), invented by German physicist Ferdinand Braun\footnote{Ferdinand Brown: 
\url{http://www.britannica.com/biography/Ferdinand-Braun}, last accessed 21 May 2016} in 1897. It has three electronic guns (Red, Green, Blue phosphor dots) and high-speed electrons from these guns hit the flat fluorescent screen line by line by and as a result the image is created on the screen.  

\item LCD (Liquid crystal display), which is widely used in in Television sets and other computer screens, and has almost replaced CRT. It uses Light-modulating properties of liquid crystal\footnote{Liquid Crystal: \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid\_crystal}, last access 21 may 2016},which does not shot light rays to show images. 

\item PDP (Plasma display panels), unlike LCD display is free of distortions if seen from sides. It uses tiny neon light for each pixels in the screen and that illuminates the pixels and is designed to display both analog and digital computer inputs\footnote{PDP: \url{http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/plasma-display}, last accessed 20 may 2016}.

\item OLED (Organic Light-Emitting Diode) this technology uses light emitting diodes that allow higher resolution and screen size. It is one of the expensive displays and has wide viewing angle and has better power consumption.

\item There are various other display technologies used for different purposes and screen sizes as listed below.

\begin{itemize}
\item E Ink (Electronic paper)
\item PDP (Plasma display panel)
\item ELD (Electroluminescent display)
\item DMS (Digital microshutter)
\item ...

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\item Sensors: \\
Now technologies are highly advancing and day-by-day new sensors for different purposes are being made. The sensor that in past was difficult to use due to many dependencies and higher cost, is now easy to use with very limited requirements and less price. Sensors are listed based on their purposes as below.


\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Presense} \\
Presence is the state or fact of being present as with others or in a place\footnote{Presence: http://www.dictionary.com/browse/presence}, there are sensors that can sense if someone is at the proximity or vicinity of the display and can even sense how far the person is in meter or centimeter in relation to display. 


\begin{itemize}
\item Cameras: \\
Now there are many cheap and powerful cameras that has built-in integrated firmware that does Human tracking so easy. For example Microsoft Kinect Camera\footnote{Microsoft Kinect: \url{https://developer.microsoft.com/de-de/windows/kinect}, Last accessed: 1/05/2016 at 13:21:00}, which comes in two versions Kinect xbox360(V1) and Kinect One (V2). These cameras can sense the location and orientation of the person. Other cameras could also be used to manual computer vision tracking applications.

\item Audio sensors\footnote{Audio sensors: \url{https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/186}, last accessed 22 may 2016}: \\
The use of microphones allows us to track sound frequencies. The distance of a device can be estimated from the source sounds originating from.

\item Bluetooth: \\
Devices that have Bluetooth functionality can be another medium of detection and interaction with displays.

\item IR (Infrared): \\
This could be used to sense the people around as it was used in \emph{MemeTags} \cite{meme-tags}.

\item RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification):\\
RFID serves the same as bar code it can be attached at backside of card. This technology could be used to sense if there is someone near display.



\end{itemize}


\item \textbf{Body position and Posture}
Body position can be detected with pressure sensors installed on the ground floor this would accurately detect the exact coordinate. Beside that camera can also detect exact position like Kinect camera. Body posture is the orientation of body where actually the body is facing to; this can be detected using 3D Camera or motion tracking. 

\item \textbf{Getures}
Gesture gives more control to the system while interaction, it could be used for manipulating some objects on the screen or control elements, there are many technologies that recognize gestures, like touch screens, accelerometer, and most widely used now is the use of camera in which the user hand or eye or different body posture can be used as some sort of gestures. 

\item \textbf{Touch}
There are various touch technologies available, the use of touch technology evolved from smart phone like iPhone, and spread to screens, Now mobile screen can support multi-touch and screens beside multi-touch can even support multi-user multi touch, touch could be sensed by the display directly or by IR camera that uses computer vision software to track users finger.

\end{itemize}

\item WiFi 
WiFi allows computers, smartphones, tablets or other personal smart devices to connect to private LAN (Local Area Network) or Internet, the use of this technology has become very frequent and almost all handheld devices has the capability to connect, By using this technology people can connect to public displays and interact by using some applications or web controllers. 

\end{itemize}
