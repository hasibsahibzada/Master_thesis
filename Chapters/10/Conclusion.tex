\section{Summary of research}
Public displays are in fact very complex research areas, and there are many reasons that could make the research at risk, like different backgrounds of passers-by are, display locations, display sizes, display orientation, physical setup and no commonly accepted method for evaluation. Human emotions provides important feedbacks about a display, and there exists technologies that can track the human emotions and state of their conditions\cite{TrackeMotion} The location of display also has influence on the attention level and motivations, if the displays are placed in front of the passers-by, could have different attention level compared to sideway or if the display is placed in a higher compared to placed in lower place or even at eye distance \cite{WhenPublicDisplays}. Displays are found in various sizes and based on sizes they are used for various purposes, small sized displays are mostly used for single users and large displays would be suitable for more multi user interactive applications, and the size can also influence on the attention level \cite{WhenPublicDisplays}. Orientation also influences the behavior of people in various was, how display are angled, horizontal or vertical conditions will produce different results\cite{DisplayAngleEffect}. Environment also has influence, if a display is installed in a cafe or train station\cite{multimediaworkplace}, or installed in a library or workplace \cite{multimediaworkplace}, would produce different outcomes \cite{semidisplay}., or if one is installed in a party compared one installed in formal meeting. Because of the problems mentioned above, most researchers limit all their findings to a fixed environment and conditions, and can not generalize their study design and findings to whole the displays, therefor there is no commonly acceptable technique of evaluation for public displays \cite{HowToEvaluate} 

Consequently, public display advertising also inherit the above issues in research field, therefor in this study also specific conditions were taken in to account, in which the main study was conducted in Tourist information center, and the an interactive and non-interactive advertisements were developed for Bauhaus-walk and the activating components of the \emph{conversion} (action) of the advertisements were measured and compared against each other, there are various activating components like emotions, motives, attentions and engagements of passers-by, which would eventually lead to actions like participation in Bauhaus-Walk program. The study compared the attention, engagement and other behaviors of the conditions and briefly answers the research questions bellow.




\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Which method is better to attract passers-by's attention?}
To design an attracting attention method for interactive advertisements, an intense background study was done on attention and based on that three methods (moving eye, firework and silhouette) were proposed and compared against non-interactive advertisement, and among the three, the silhouette representation attracted more passers-by than other two, and beside that this method was a more widely acceptable method for interactive displays from the literatures. As a result the silhouette representation was used for the rest of interactive advertisements.


\item \textbf{How is the attention level in interactive (body and mobile) and non-interactive advertisement?} \\
Glance is when a user look at display for less than 3 seconds in an observable manner by moving the head orientation toward display. 

In non-interactive advertisement \%28, in body interactive \%41.41, and in mobile version \%33.76 of the passers-by glanced toward the display, among which body interactive showed higher amount of glances. Enhanced interactive advertisement strongly increased the number of glances by \%50 compared to non-interactive and body interactive.

Honeypot effect, which increases the attention level of passers-by toward display, was also statistically increased with the use of body interactive advertisement compared to non-interactive advertisement, and the mobile interactive was insignificant to non-interactive. In enhanced advertisement version the honeypot effects were not increase compared to body interactive maybe because of limited number of days.

Landing effects that drags the passers-by suddenly toward display, in non-interactive advertisement this effect were less than interactive advertisement both body and mobile interactive. The landing effect in enhanced version was not significant because of its extended angle of tracking.

The studies suggest that interactive advertisement in all the conditions like body, mobile and enhanced body version had higher attention level compared to non-interactive advertisement. 

\item \textbf{How many passers-by are engaged in interactive (body and mobile) and non-interactive advertisement?} \\
Involvement of passers-by with the display in some form, defines the effectiveness of advertisement, this can be achieved if the passers-by engage by viewing the screen, reading or interacting with the advertisement display.In this study a person was marked engaged if stood for more than 3 seconds in front of display.

In non-interactive advertisement people were reading or viewing the content of advertisement and only \%7.66 of the whole passers-by were engaged, and the average duration for engagement was 34 seconds.

In body interactive advertisement, users were reading the content and at the same time they were motivated to play with the silhouette and start the game interaction and let them explore the locations with their body. From the whole passers-by \%11.56 of them were engaged with the display and the average interaction was about 42 seconds, in which 19 seconds were spent in attraction/motivation part, 18 seconds in interaction and 4.6 seconds in advertisement video.

In mobile interactive advertisement, users were only reading or viewing the display, they had little interaction with their silhouette, but no interaction with the mobile devices, and \%9 of the passers-by were engaged and took 22 seconds in average for the engagement duration.

In the enhanced advertisement version, passers-by were also engaged with reading, playing with the silhouette and interacting with the game element, and \%15 passers-by were engaged with the average duration of 32 seconds. 

This recommends that enhanced and body advertisement version engaged more participants than other advertisement techniques.



%\item Which of the advertisement types would increase the duration of engagement? \\

\item \textbf{What are passers-by behavior toward interactive (body and mobile) and non-interactive advertisemen?} \\
In non-interactive advertisement, the behavior of passers-by toward display was more passive, calm and natural, passers-by selectively came near the display and used it as a source of information, and at the same time neglected it easily. There was no influence of display on the environment around.

On the other hand, in body interactive advertisement, passers-by were attracted quickly toward display, passers-by were curious about their silhouette representation; they were waving hands or moving their body explicitly and learning about the interactivity, they felt the sense of joy and fun and reacted according to the call-to-action, they explored the interactions and played the game, the interaction was in groups and individuals, and the people were calling other friends to join. When the game was over, the advertisement video was shown but people tried to ignore that by leaving the display or standing one side until the video was over and start over the interaction. The dominance of the display over the area was felt if a person noticed the screen, the person had to leave the area or start the interaction. 

In mobile interactive, the passers-by had some similar behaviors like, they were being curious about their silhouette representation, they were waving their hands to confirm interactivity and coming closer to the screen to understand the interactivity of the system, but quickly left the display, maybe because of begin skeptical about technology usage like using phone in public, and not understanding the connectivity, feeling unsecure or feeling inappropriate interaction in that space.

In the extended advertisement version, the behaviors were very similar to body interactive advertisement, in which people felt the sense of joy, fun and play, passers-by played the game and started exploring the locations, group interactions and individual interactions were also seen, in this extended version people noticed the interactivity earlier and came toward display with very less landing effects. Side interactions were also observed, in which the people stood at side of the screen and were still playing with their silhouette.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{R1: }What are the characteristics of a good and a bad Advertisement? (Chapter 3)  \\
From the short survey about characteristic of advertisement, participants answers were generalized and concluded that, a good advertisement from people points of view is an advertisement that provides most relevant content to the theme, environment and even passers-by, is short and precise, should have creativity and some kind of interactivity, and a bad advertisement is a kind of advertisement that does not suite to the passers-by and theme, is boring, has a lot of contents and annoys people by repetition, flashy texts and picture.
\item \textbf{R2: }Which method is better to attract passers-by's attention?  (Chapter 3) \\
Mirrored silhouette representation of passers-by attracted more participants than other abstract representation in a field study, which was conducted in university Mensa, and it is a preferred method in public displays in which passers-by feel comfortable and excitement. 

\item \textbf{R3: }How to create a suitable interactive and non-interactive advertisement?}(Chapter 4)\\
Any company that wants to advertise its product or service needs to define the advertising objectives in which it should prepare the content, scope, duration, and target a specific group of people. A good way to plan for the advertising goal is to conduct a focus group with the stakeholders. I planned two sessions for focus group with Bauhaus-Walk members, in the first session we discussed on content, theme, target audience and more. And on the second session proper prototype of interactive advertisement was discussed to finalize an advertisement that would be suitable for non-interactive, body interactive and mobile interactive. 

Interactive map was chosen for Bauhaus-walk, on which different interest points of Bauhaus was shown with picture and text description. Non-interactive advertisement would randomly explore the locations. In body interactive, passers-by would explore the locations by moving their body in front of the display. In Mobile interactive the same content would be explored by using a mobile controller. 

\item \textbf{R4: }How to design and evaluate Advertisement's Low-fidelity prototypes for public display?(Chapter 5) \\
When an advertisement is in its early stages, formative study would be a preferred way to evaluate the developed paper prototype, to be able to see most of the main functionalities and tackle the usability issues. Bauhaus-Walk advertisement’s interactive paper prototype was developed both for body interaction and mobile interaction, both prototypes could simulate almost the real life scenarios, a moderator was performing as a computer to get the user input and produce the output on the display, all the process was video recorded and had a follow up interview to get users opinions. 


\item \textbf{R5: }How to design and evaluate Advertisement's High-fidelity prototype for public display?
\item \textbf{R6: }What are the differences between non-interactive and interactive ad in public display?
\item \textbf{R7: }What could be enhanced to develop better advertisement in public display?
